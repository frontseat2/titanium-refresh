# Run your iOS Titanium app changes without having to restart the simulator

Normally a code change requires a restart of the iOS simulator.
To make the development cycle a little faster, this tool will do the same without restarting the simulator

## How it works
The tool does the following:
1. Running your pre-compile hooks (if you have any)
2. Use the ios-sim tool to restart your app in the simulator
3. Show the log file output

## Usage
(TODO)
